Polygon2Triangle
===========================

Polygon2Triangle is a simple MFC application which is used to triangulate polygons.
The implementation of triangulation algorithm is based on poly2tri.js
> - **poly2tri.js:** A 2D constrained Delaunay triangulation library
> - Based on the paper "Sweep-line algorithm for constrained Delaunay triangulation" by V. Domiter and and B. Zalik
